What's My Score App built with NativeScript + Angular 2 + TypeScript 

## Progress
- Building. 
- "ANGULAR BOOTSTRAP DONE".
- Some sort of routing done. 

## To-do: 
1. create the project equal to  [the ionic version](https://github.com/matt4446/WhatsMyScore2-Ionic2) 

1.1. Routing has been setup - Angular 2 Router [following TJ's example for the moment](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries/tree/710de30fdfe8640cabb489fb64ac02c1af894926)

1.2. Bar basic navigation - not much to look at.

## Genymotion
This project is using [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/#!/) and an old HTC Android device to test with. Test it as you will.
