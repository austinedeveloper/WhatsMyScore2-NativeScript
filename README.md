# WhatsMyScore2 - NativeScript
What's My Score App built with NativeScript + Angular 2 + TypeScript 

## Getting Started
Make sure you have all the tools to run [NativeScript](http://docs.nativescript.org/start/getting-started) 

## What am I up to. 
I could build it up in a rush with the current components but that would'nt really domonstrate angular2.

## To-do: 
1. create the project equal to  [the ionic version](https://github.com/matt4446/WhatsMyScore2-Ionic2) 
    - Start page - *Started*
    - Regions page - *Started*
    - Region page - placeholder
2. Menu navigation
3. Angular2 Nativescript components
    - List control: **nx-list** - *Started* [link](https://github.com/matt4446/WhatsMyScore2-NativeScript/app/pages/startPage/startPage.html)
    - List item control: **nx-list-item** - *Started*
    - Animation - next
4. Styling 


## Completed: 
1. Routing - it's alright, not perfect. 
    - Routing has been setup - Angular 2 Router [following TJ's example for the moment](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries/tree/710de30fdfe8640cabb489fb64ac02c1af894926)



## Progress
- Building. 
- "ANGULAR BOOTSTRAP DONE".
- Some sort of routing done.
